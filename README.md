## Development guidelines
**1. How to contribute**
Create a new branch with 
```

```
add commits to your branch, and create a pull request when the changes are ready to be merged into the `main` branch.
The pull request should be reviewed by at least 1 person who did not author it.

**2. What to contribute**
Any code that is intended to become part of an analysis should be committed to the `main` branch through a PR.
Code that has been used to help inform decisions about analysis strategy should also be included.

When presenting studies using code from `HggNanoAnalysis`, include the git commit hash of your working branch in your slides.
